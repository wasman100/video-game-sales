# Final Project Title

## Introduction

Hello for the below data you will see i am using sales of indivual video games from a multi tude of consoles and generas and ratings what i wanted to do is find the corralation to the sales of video game to the score that people who played them and see if it has a big or bigger affect then that of what a critic would give the game so i basically wanted to see what was more influential in some one buying a game is it because of a critic or is it more likely because of users recommending it? Well lets find out. 

## Data Dictionary

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| critic scores | scores/ratings that a critic gave a game |
| user scores | score/rating a user gave a game |
| North America sales | sales of the game |

based on the data showen i was able to discover two things that where interesting one is that user and critic scores both seem to have about the same effect on the sale of a game and secondly it seems users tend to score the game on a 1 to 10 scale interestingly enough as such it seems about even with each other with coralation to sales in north america
